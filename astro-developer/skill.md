# Building Astro Websites

## Overview

Astro is a modern front-end framework and static site generator that emphasizes performance by shipping minimal JavaScript. It supports content-rich sites, blogs, portfolios, and complex web applications. You can start from an empty project or choose from hundreds of community-built templates. Astro uses file-based routing, supports Markdown/MDX content, and integrates UI libraries like React, Svelte, or Vue.

Use the references below to keep this skill concise while preserving full coverage. Load only what is needed for the task at hand.

## Quick Start

1. Scaffold a new project: `npm create astro@latest`.
2. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`.
3. Build for production: `npm run build`.

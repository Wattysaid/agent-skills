# Skill Authoring Notes

These guidelines were preserved from the original skill content to avoid losing any capabilities or intent.

1. Keep the skill concise and focused. Only include instructions necessary for Astro development; avoid explaining fundamental web concepts that the agent already knows.
2. Provide step-by-step instructions for common tasks. Use bullet points and code blocks for clarity.
3. Include examples and sample commands. Examples help clarify expected workflow and outputs.
4. Use meaningful section headings. Organize the skill into logical sections like setup, templates, layouts, content, and deployment.
5. Reference additional resources. Link to external documentation or reference files when more detail is required.

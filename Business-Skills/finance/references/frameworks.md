## Core lenses
- Three-statement view: income statement, balance sheet, cash flow.
- Unit economics: CAC, LTV, payback, contribution margin.
- Budget variance: plan vs actual vs forecast.
- Sensitivity analysis: key drivers and ranges.

## Questions to drive analysis
- What metric best reflects the decision?
- What assumptions drive the result most?
- Where is liquidity at risk?

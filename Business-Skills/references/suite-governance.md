# Suite Governance

## Purpose
Maintain consistency, routing, and production readiness across the skill suite.

## Change control
- Update the root `SKILL.md` first when roles or routing change.
- Keep per-skill sections aligned (Identity, Trigger phrases, Modes, Verification).
- Update `memory-context.md` intake questions if business scope changes.

## Audit
- Run the audit in `/mnt/d/GitHub/Business Skills/audit-report.md` after changes.
- Confirm all referenced files exist and scripts run with python3.
- Verify there are no duplicate or conflicting capability maps.

## Consistency checks
- Skills use the same terminology for stages and KPIs.
- Complementary skills are mutually referenced.
- Handoff checklists reflect real-world workflow sequences.

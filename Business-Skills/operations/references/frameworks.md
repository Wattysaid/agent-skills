# Operations Frameworks

## Core frameworks
- SIPOC: suppliers, inputs, process, outputs, customers.
- Theory of Constraints: identify, exploit, subordinate, elevate.
- Lean waste: overproduction, waiting, transport, extra processing, inventory, motion, defects, unused talent.
- Value stream mapping: lead time vs process time.

## Questions to drive analysis
- What is the primary bottleneck?
- Where does work wait longest?
- What steps do not add value?

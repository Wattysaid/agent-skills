# Issue Tree Diagnostic

## What it is
A structured decomposition of a business problem into MECE branches to isolate root causes and prioritize analysis.

## When to use
- Ambiguous, cross-functional problems with multiple plausible drivers.
- Early discovery when causes are unknown.

## Why it matters
- Prevents scattershot analysis.
- Creates alignment on scope and workstreams.

## How to apply
1. Define the core problem statement.
2. Build a top-level tree (e.g., Revenue = Price x Volume).
3. Decompose each branch into testable drivers.
4. Rank branches by impact and uncertainty.
5. Validate with data and update the tree.

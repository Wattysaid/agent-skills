# Hypothesis Backlog

## What it is
A prioritized list of hypotheses tied to data requirements and decision impact.

## When to use
- You need to sequence analysis under time or data constraints.

## Why it matters
- Keeps analysis purposeful and decision-led.
- Makes trade-offs explicit when data is limited.

## How to apply
1. Convert questions into hypotheses.
2. Score each by impact and evidence gap.
3. Map data sources and owners.
4. Test in priority order and log outcomes.
